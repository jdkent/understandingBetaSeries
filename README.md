# Stop Signal Task

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jdkent/hrfViz/master?urlpath=/proxy/5006/bokeh-app)

This is a little play simulation for the stop signal task.

This app was built from a [binder template](https://github.com/binder-examples/bokeh)
and the [sliders example](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/app/sliders.py) from bokeh.
